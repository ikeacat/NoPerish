# NoPerish
Never perish. Ever.

Basically just pings NationStates every time you start up your computer.

Supports Windows 10/11 & Systemd on Linux (at least it should).

**FYI: There's a macOS version being developed [here](https://www.github.com/ikeacat/NoPerish-macOS). It's not ready and doesn't remotely work but you can stare at it I guess.**
